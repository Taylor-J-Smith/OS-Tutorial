##Application Questions

1. Done, but need to display the tree in a nice format.
2. **OPEN**

##Conceptual Questions

**1. What is an Abstract Data Type(ABT)?**

  An abstract data type is a data type that is defined by its behavior as it appears to the user of that data type.

**2. Explain the difference between a queue(FIFO) and a stack(LIFO).**

  In a queue elements are removed from the queue in the same order they were placed in, or first one in is the first one out. In a stack elements are removed based on which one was most recently added, or last one in is the first one out.

**3. Name and briefly explain three types of data structures.**

  Queue - A FIFO structure used for storing items in the order they are to be used(which is the same as the order they were recieved). Each element has data as well as a pointer to the next element in the queue.
  Binary Tree - A structure where each node can have up to two children a left and a right child. Each node has data as well as a pointer to its two children.
  Stack - A LIFO structure where elements are put onto the top of the stack and then have to be removed in reverse order. Each element has data as well as a pointer to the next element in the stack.

**4. Explain what a binary tree is, what are some common operations of a binary tree?**

  A binary tree is a data structure where each node can have at most two children, as well as some data. Common operations of a binary tree are insert, delete, search.

**5. Explain what a hash table (directory) is, what are common operations of a hash table?**

  A hash table is a data structure used to implement associative arrays, where you can have key value pairs where the key maps to the value when used in a hash function. Some common operations on a hash table are put, get, remove, clear, key list, value list, modify.
